One\u2010third of the sample did not know what\nbiotechnology or genetic engineering was, and nearly half the sample\ncould not give examples of either. Student attitudes were\ncontext\u2010dependent: there was broad approval of genetic engineering\napplied to microbes and plants but not of its application to animals.\nThere were high levels of uncertainty of opinion where eating the\nproducts of genetic engineering was concerned. Teaching about these\ntopics led to decreased uncertainty and enhanced approval of genetic\nengineering.</jats:p>",

Describes the efforts made to validate it by attempting implementation in a medium size manufacturing enterprise. Presents financial statements concerning a quality circle prepared using a commercially available accounting package.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>As a consequence of digitization, universities have to investigate their scholarly communication process. In fact, this is a quest for values that goes beyond the issues of the day. Once found, these values operate as criteria for assessing competencies, roles and instruments. The communication process must allow for free exchange of ideas and results. In particular, knowledge created in the public domain must be openly accessible. The process must be reliable, lend credibility to authors and give support to users. The respective competencies are logistics, validation and mediation. New technologies not only support these classical aspirations, but also develop their own dynamics when it comes to broadening the communication scope. Publications can be enhanced by including audio\u2010visuals, executable files and datasets. Linking techniques enable the creation of organically growing bodies of knowledge. Who is the fittest for this scholarly communication job? Is it universities and their libraries and university presses, or could it best remain in the hands of global publishing monopolies?</jats:p>",

Describes how VSA has, in the past, been treated differently to abuse of other drugs, both legal and illegal, but that most agencies now believe it should be dealt with alongside other drugs. Reviews the main findings of a report on volatile substances from the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, and the Government\u2019s response to it. Describes the measure put in place in the UK to help control the supply of sniffable substances, and the need for education campaigns for parents and young people. Concludes there are no grounds for optimism, as the latest figures on deaths due to VSA show a rise. Gives recommendations for professionals who wish to seek further help for those involved with VSA.</jats:p>",

Questions the role and\nfunction of myth in the life of managers and the influence of myth on\norganizations. Attempts to increase understanding of the power of myth\nto communicate and engender commitment, beliefs and existing cultures by\nlooking at the mythical element embedded in symbols, stories and\nlanguage. Research reported here and which is ongoing, suggests managers\ndo in fact often act and make decisions based on mythical realities;\nthat myths contribute to maintenance of the status quo and an unhealthy\nreliance on past memories and experience. Myths held dear by managers\nthus inhibit the learning and change so vital to all who live in a world\nwhich is dominated by change.</jats:p>",

However, fish wastes pose a particular technological problem, as they release high levels of ammonia when digested, which then inhibits the digestion process. Having overcome these technical problems, it is important that there is a long term, financially viable outlet for the products of the digestion process. The organic sector places high demands on the production of certified inputs, but, if these can be met, this sector represents a potentially high value market for the products of a digestion process.</jats:p>",

The annual survey has been supported by the International Association of Corporate Real Estate Executives (NACORE International) and the Industrial Development Research Council (IDRC), two leading professional associations concerned with this field of professional activity. The emphasis of this summary is on two aspects of the survey: the incidence of corporate real estate management (CREM) policies, functions, and activities; and the assessment of knowledge or skills relevant to the CREM function in the future. Both are of paramount interest to the educational institutions concerned with CREM on both sides of the Atlantic. This includes the educational organs of international organizations concerned with corporate real estate, such as NACORE and IDRC, which play increasingly important roles in the education of their members. The CREMRU annual survey will hopefully offer a useful tool in the international educational effort in this field.</jats:p>",

Based on this framework, examines consumer analysis needs in the context of the WWW medium and proposes analysis variables relevant to this medium. Finally, discusses how the information needs for consumer analysis may be met from the different information sources available to a marketer, including the Web logfiles which are generated as a result of tracking the interactions of visitors accessing information from a company\u2019s Web site.</jats:p>",

The intent was to measure current level of physical compliance with the ADA; future plans in meeting or exceeding ADA requirements; and barriers which impeded complete compliance. The participants in this study were selected from a list of hotels and motels contained in the 1994 version of the <jats:italic>Hotel and Travel Index</jats:italic>. The lodging operations were represented by full service, limited service and economy properties which varied from 25 to 615 guest rooms per property, restaurant, and meeting facilities. The findings of this study suggested that total compliance has not been achieved in certain areas, vagueness of the legislation is not necessarily a barrier in compliance, and financial constraints are a barrier in non\u2010compliance. Implies that lodging operators must properly position their products and services, otherwise the disabled travellers\u2019 needs will not be totally met, and that lodging operators need to continue their civic respon\u2010 sibility for meeting the needs of the disabled travellers\u2019 needs.</jats:p>",

The findings stem from a one\u2010year research project funded by the British National Bibliographic Research Fund during the period December 1998 through to the end of August 1999. The author of this article (who comes from a business/economics background) worked with a prominent academic (in the field of economics, particularly in the book trade) Dr Frank Fishwick, to investigate where cost savings could be made in elements of the library supply chain. The results suggest that wider adoption of EDI could potentially save the sector somewhere in the region of \u00a32 million per annum. Cultural barriers, however, and lack of resources present two major barriers to these savings being achieved. The author acknowledges that further research is needed to qualify such estimates. However, the research does demonstrate that, for those authorities examined, cost savings have been achieved.</jats:p>",

In the context\nof the latter, the emphasis will be on the European Commission\u2032s\nproposals for European undertakings to establish European works councils\n(EWCs). As will be detailed below, these proposals were contained in a\ndraft directive, agreed in 1991, and are now being progressed under the\nprovisions of the Social Protocol. Also draws on empirical research\nundertaken in East Anglia to determine the extent to which trade unions\ncontinue to be recognized, and the employers\u2032 awareness of the content\nof EC/EU initiatives.

The main conclusions are that short\u2010term strategic planning is well established, but that systematic long\u2010range planning around the effects of technology and e\u2010commerce on space is limited, in extent and scope.</jats:p>",

This focused particularly on its effectiveness at analysing quality non\u2010compliances logged by staff. This survey highlighted cultural problems, in particular staff resentment towards the quality system, the inadequacies of the software to provide management with the required information, and how the non\u2010compliance system encouraged hostile relationships between departments. All of these factors hindered the implementation process and meant that no one was willing to use the software. Describes how Cowie Group management sought to overcome these problems and make staff aware of the importance of following the quality system by redefining it in language which it believed staff would more readily understand \u2010 that of how much quality non\u2010compliances cost the Cowie Group in lost profit and the staff in lost potential bonus payments. Looks briefly at attempts made by others to analyse complaints effectively and relates this experience to the Cowie Group situation. Concludes by proposing further research to investigate development of an appropriate quality cost model for the Cowie Group and whether or not this results in the desired improvement in staff attitude.</jats:p>",

Shows, in detail, that the schemes operate on an informal basis, lacking any form of co\u2010ordination, in the absence of any rules or regulatory code. Concludes that the lack of written rules and manuals has resulted in ILL arrangements failing to operate smoothly and that there is an urgent need to introduce an effective regulatory structure.</jats:p>",

The major contribution of the model is to assign tolerances with maximization of the conformance rate of the entire process. The cumulative standard normal probability is used to estimate the scrap rate of each operation with respect to the machining accuracy of equipment, therefore, the design engineers are able to predict the failure rate before production. Results of comparison with other methods indicate that the proposed model can cost\u2010effectively assign tolerances.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Rapport is important in business. It can be described as a feeling you experience when you are with someone you intuitively like. And since so much of communication is non\u2010verbal, rapport is often developed on more of a subconscious or subliminal level. There are many methods and ways to help establish and build rapport. Some of these are verbal, such as matching another\u2019s rate of speech. But many are through non\u2010verbal communication, such as pacing, mirroring, leading, or study of another\u2019s sensory perceptions. Contends that using these techniques in building rapport can help us in our personal relationships, and certainly has application in business as well.</jats:p>",

A computer simulation programme and ANOVA were conducted to identify which factors significantly affect the measures of performance of the system. The results clearly indicated that certain factors have a more significant effect on the measures of performance than the others. A classification of the relative significance of input factors affecting such a system is made. In order to investigate the generality of the results, alternative station configurations and factor levels are examined. The outcome shows that the results are applicable to different configurations of FHAS.</jats:p>",

The need to improve responsiveness and reduce overheads is focusing management attention on the major internal business functions such as IT. Argues that these functions, threatened with major cost reductions or outsourcing, are increasingly feeling the need to understand better their customers business needs and to assess how successful they are in satisfying them. Any customer satisfaction assessment tool must recognize the varying needs of individual \u201ccustomers\u201d within the \u201ccustomer\u201d organizations. Data collection must lead to prompt action: \u201cevent\u2010driven\u201d assessments owned by \u201cempowered\u201d teams of service providers can help achieve this. Such a \u201cfast cycle\u201d satisfaction assessment/improvement process will not happen spontaneously: \u201cselling\u201d, training, culture change and management leadership are needed to embed action\u2010oriented customer\u2010satisfaction assessment in internal service providers.</jats:p>",

This paper addresses some of the issues that face the developers of such systems. It shows that current technology cannot satisfy fully the expectation and that such systems will challenge many well\u2010established cultural aspects and infrastructures of organizations. The views expressed are based on the experience of the author who worked for 18 months on a project for the British Library, codenamed DiSCovery (now called <jats:italic>Inside</jats:italic>). This product seeks to combine the latest technology and operational practices into a system that has the potential to revolutionize the way users access and receive material from the British Library.</jats:p>",

Then look for training programs that will help you develop the skills necessary to succeed and to reach that goal.

Presents a prediction and diagnosis method that has been developed and tested in two production departments. Describes how the method provides realistic logistic performance targets in the short term with respect to the throughput of a production department and order completion times. The method also quantitatively determines <jats:italic>ex post</jats:italic> the impact of occurred disturbances on the realized performance. In the pilot project the method provided a clearer insight into relationships between logistic key variables, gave decision support to the capacity allocation decision, and generated reliable performance targets for the short term. More importantly, the actual performance became more open to discussion due to the objective explanation of the achieved performance, which opens the way to performance improvements.</jats:p>",

The failed product will be minimally repaired by the manufacturer during the preassigned warranty, the length of which is determined by mileage or age, whichever occurs first. Under general distributions, obtains the formula of the expected value and variance of total warranty cost. Analyses special cases of the failure and running behaviours. Includes a numerical example.</jats:p>",

Develops an availability model for a hardware\u2010software system. The system treated here consists of one hardware and one software subsystem. For the software subsystem, in particular, it is supposed that: the restoration actions are not always performed perfectly; the restoration times for later software failures become longer; and reliability growth occurs in the perfect restoration action. The hardware\u2010 and software\u2010failure occurrence phenomena are described by a constant and a geometrically decreasing hazard rate, respectively. The time\u2010dependent behavior of the system is described by a Markov process. Useful expressions for several quantitative measures of system performance are derived from this model. Finally, numerical examples are presented for illustration of system availability measurement and assessment.</jats:p>",

The QA organization provides a division of this\nfacility into three areas with different requirements on the measures to\nbe taken. For classification of systems and companies the results of the\nsafety assessment, in particular of the incident analysis, are used.\nThe waste package QC, i.e. the fulfillment of waste acceptance\nrequirements, is either to be performed by checking the waste producer\u2019s\ndocumentation and carrying out random tests or by qualifying and\nsubsequently inspecting the waste conditioning process.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\u201cTwin metric\u201d control preserves the simple, intuitive graphical features of Shewhart control charts, while incorporating the much improved performance of CUSUM. Two metrics are plotted on the twin metric control chart at each sample interval; the Shewhart value and a simplified CUSUM value. The action limits for the two metrics are numerically identical. The name twin metric emphasizes this identity. Twin metric responsiveness, measured in terms of the average run length (ARL) curve, is several times better than Shewhart control, with or without runs rules to supplement the Shewhart chart. Twin metric enables substantially better response to real process shifts and substantially fewer false alarms compared to Shewhart charts. Discusses the conceptual framework, the arithmetic formulas, and the operational aspects, including estimation of the process standard deviation, estimation of the current process average after a twin metric signal, and monitoring process variability using twin metric control. Provides a table of ARLs for six twin metric options. Gives quantitative performance comparisons comparing twin metric to Shewhart and to combined Shewhart\u2010CUSUM.</jats:p>",

Three quality management approaches already tested in Russia, namely, third party certification, self\u2010assessment and a Russian/Western hybrid model, all have significant drawbacks. The priority must be for the creation of an educational and institutional infrastructure for quality management. The conclusions in this paper are also relevant to the other republics of the former Soviet Union and East European countries.</jats:p>",

We propose a transition life cycle model that is in agreement with the existing life cycle models. The building blocks of the research are the results of an extensive literature search and a series of industrial interviews. The desired expectation of this effort was to find methods for moving NASA\u2019s space shuttle program into an era of routine, timely operations. Proposes utilizing some existing concepts of change for achieving a smooth transformation under various levels of technical, political, cultural, managerial and economic uncertainties. Recommends an initial planning stage followed by various possible courses of actions and considerations for the transition. We hope that the framework presented in this paper will serve the individuals and organizations considering a major transition, especially those from a research and development to an operational one.</jats:p>",

It is assumed that the parameter of the lifetime distribution is a random variable varying from lot to lot according to a known prior distribution. Describes constructions of a cost model with three cost components: test cost, accept cost, and reject cost. Presents an algorithm for finding optimal sampling plans which minimize the expected average cost per lot. Describes sensitivity analyses for the parameters for the prior distribution.</jats:p>",

The system, which is still under development, is the product of fusing two existing and independently developed packages, and the current implementation serves as a pilot design for evaluating the issues involved, both in terms of product development and in terms of the theoretical difficulties in combining discrete\u2010event and continuous\u2010time systems. The initial design has already been implemented and test simulations performed. Provides a superficial description of the system interface which is predominantly based on the existing interface of the discrete\u2010event simulator.</jats:p>",

This paper investigates the applicability of the Web\u2010based technology to the support of team meetings in Korean corporations. We first examine key cultural characteristics of Korean enterprises as they relate to the way the firms conduct team meetings, and discuss a few design issues in the context of the characteristics. We argue that the organizational culture of Korean firms calls for a merger of text\u2010based electronic meeting support with video conferencing capability if meetings are to be productive. Ultimately, we envision an integrated team support system that meets the needs of Korean firms for collaborative tasks regardless of the time and location dimensions.</jats:p>",

Internet sites are selected by subject specialists and described using an extension of qualified Dublin Core metadata. A basic evaluation is added. These descriptions are freely available and can be searched and browsed. There are now subject gateways for three subject areas: earth sciences (Geo\u2010guide); mathematics (Mathguide); and Anglo\u2010American culture (split into History guide and Anglistik guide). Together they receive about 3,300 \u201chard\u201d requests per day, thus reaching over 1 million requests per year. The project SSG\u2010FI behind these guides is open to collaboration. Institutions and private persons wishing to contribute can notify the SSG\u2010FI team or send full data sets. Regular contributors can request registration with the project to access the database via the Internet and create and edit records.</jats:p>",

Of particular concern is the emergence of strains of increased virulence, for example <jats:italic>Escherichia coli 0157</jats:italic>. As we are likely to be faced with a succession of food hygiene challenges in our kitchens, do consumers have access to the information they need and is it presented in such a way that it encourages and motivates towards good food handling and food hygiene practices? This paper concentrates on a range of food hygiene information provided by the Government, the Health Education Authority and the media. The information is examined with respect to availability, content and context. Observations are made from sociological, scientific and visual communications perspectives.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Duodenal action of rapidly digested carbohydrate can induce an intense satiation shortly after the meal, which conditions down the volume of food eaten in the later part of the meal. In contrast, after a meal rich in spreading fat, separation of fat above the aqueous contents of the stomach is liable to delay the fat\u2019s emptying and hence its contact with satiety receptors in the small intestine; eaters are therefore unlikely to learn to eat less of a menu rich in separated fat. Yet the delayed emptying may prolong the period of digestion and absorption of separated fat beyond that for the same amount of fat emulsified or bound in the aqueous phase. Hence, separating fat might help to delay better the rise of appetite for the next meal several hours later. These ideas explain some of the diversity of claims about satiation from fats in foods. Observes how individuals learn from the post\u2010ingestional effects on appetite of variants of the foods they choose routinely.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>By definition the practice of job\u2010sharing starts from the premiss that there is a full\u2010time job to be shared by those who want to balance their work with other commitments. In a public sector institution, such as the National Health Service (NHS), where most employees are female, it seems logical to believe that a job\u2010sharing policy would be able to promote equal opportunities, to increase employee job satisfaction and to reduce labour costs. Hence, this paper attempts to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of having a job\u2010sharing policy, and to analyse the reasons for the limited number of job\u2010sharers in the NHS despite the apparent benefits of job\u2010sharing to both the employees and the employer. This study was carried out in 15 NHS Trusts in northern England and Scotland, by the use of questionnaires and interviews, and found that most NHS managers did not see the practice of job\u2010sharing as a major cost\u2010saving opportunity or as a working pattern that would enhance employee satisfaction and commitment. They saw job\u2010sharing as just a routine equal opportunities request which did not deserve such managerial attention or long\u2010term strategic thinking. It is argued in this paper that job\u2010sharing is a potentially useful option against a background of demographic and other social and economic changes which require the development and use of long\u2010term strategic policies. Therefore it is concluded that, in the NHS, there is a need for a more active and creative approach to job\u2010sharing rather than the reactive and passive approach that has dominated the practice so far.</jats:p>",

Self\u2010generation of electricity or cogeneration of electricity and thermal energy at the manufacturer\u2019s location can provide both economical and uninterrupted service. Generation methods are standby, peak\u2010shaving, baseload, commercial, and mobile generation. Each of these represents opportunities in agile manufacturing. The number of countries that have deregulated, market\u2010driven electrical utilities are growing and will include most of Europe and the USA by 2005. The demands of agile manufacturing are to produce high\u2010quality, market\u2010sensitive products at the lowest possible cost in an environment that has constant dynamic changes. Cogeneration will provide both flexible and cost\u2010efficient electricity as part of an overall energy strategy. Further, it will provide an agile energy resource that will complement the pursuit of competitive advantage in the global market for customized goods and services.</jats:p>",

These\npressures, largely brought about by the Government\u2032s attempt to open out\ntelevision and make it more commercial in the way it works, have\nresulted in libraries closing down, the shrinkage of existing libraries,\nand the development of a strong cost\u2010conscious and income\u2010generating\nculture. Few libraries in the field now employ more than three or four\npeople and it is estimated that there has been a reduction of between a\nquarter and a third in the library workforce over the last three years.\nIt is unlikely that the workforce will ever return to its original size.\nWith the market forces contracting\u2010out philosophy sweeping other sectors\nof the information field there is a lot to be learnt from the dramatic\nexperiences of the Independent Television libraries. Largely based on a\nquestionnaire and interview survey of 15 ITV libraries in England and\nWales which was conducted at the University of North London during the\nspring of 1993, with some updating of the situation undertaken in the\nwinter of 1993/94.</jats:p>",

Circumstances and situations will determine the stimulus which will generate response \u2013 to drive forward, to withdraw or to wait for a further signal. Once the response is decided, the degree of general purpose enthusiasm evoked will control the momentum. For people in the workplace, their employers set the targets and the strategies for achieving them, provide the resources, including all maintenance and operating costs, and expect the desired results. Compliance will follow, but not necessarily commitment. Commitment is a voluntary response which cannot be mandated, but it will be the outcome of relationships which create a shared purpose.</jats:p>",

Pre\u2010school children are at particular risk and account for 30 percent of child attendances following an accident at Hull Royal Infirmary Accident and Emergency Department. With children spending more time outside the home at pre\u2010schools, playgroups and nurseries there is a need to ensure that accident prevention and safety remains high on their agenda. This paper details the development of the Focus on Safety award scheme developed by a multi\u2010agency group in Hull. Participating groups are asked to consider their own health and safety policies and how they promote accident prevention to both children and their parents / carers. The pilot of the Award Scheme showed that it was very popular with nurseries, pre\u2010schools and playgroups and that it was meeting a definite need.</jats:p>",

Changing business models used to be a once\u2010a\u2010career challenge. Now it\u2019s the way firms compete. Most organizations have not been terribly successful at changing themselves, even at the old pace. It requires learning, becoming a \u201clearning organization,\u201d and building a culture of learning. But many executives aren\u2019t buying. Many firms still relegate learning activities to the training department and look there first for cost cuts when business hiccups.

To get the benefits of learning \u2013 the management culture that makes an organization agile amidst shape\u2010changing markets \u2013 executives must be willing to face the cost: threatening, gut\u2010wrenching, personally invasive change, not just for the rest of the firm, but for the leaders themselves.</jats:p>",

The impact of growth in student numbers, changes in funding and management arrangements at national and local levels, and quality assurance mechanisms, is explored. The study also describes the major problems associated with quantitative and qualitative research in this sector, compares the results achieved and identifies areas for future research.</jats:p>",

The edge element (EE) method using vector magnetic potential has been applied. Special attention is paid to the saturation effects in permanent magnet motors. In order to solve the non\u2010linear EE equations the authors propose to apply the modified Newton algorithm with block relaxation solver and Cholesky decomposition procedure for block matrices. The convergence of the algorithm is analysed. The influence of core non\u2010linearity on the values of electromagnetic torque and armature inductances is considered. The results for 3D and 2D models are compared.</jats:p>",

Reports on data which were collected by questionnaires completed anonymously. Women expressed significantly greater interest in such career options than did men. Women and men expressing greater interest in such options described the firm in more negative ways and reported both less job satisfaction and greater intention to quit. Women and men who were married, and who had children, were more interested in alternative career options. In addition, women who spent more time commuting to work, and women whose spouses worked more hours than they did, were also more interested in them. Men whose spouses were employed outside the home for pay also expressed greater interest in them as well. It seems that organizations might increase satisfaction and reduce turnover of some employees by providing such alternatives.</jats:p>",

Provides a comprehensive discussion of the concept of manufacturing focus. Suggests the implementation of manufacturing focus as an approach to integrate marketing needs and manufacturing systems design. Proposes a five\u2010step procedure for implementing the concept of manufacturing focus, based on observations from a case study and related literature. Identifies critical issues in each implementation step and makes suggestions for dealing with these issues. Concludes that a model that provides such a systematic implementation procedure should enable managers to integrate marketing and manufacturing functions.</jats:p>",

The issues are: (1) more control to member libraries; (2) pre\u2010migration decisions; (3) Web interface design; (4) training; (5) consortium staffing; (6) communication; (7) system maintenance; (8) security issues; (9) telecommunications network; and (10) commitment of member libraries. The capabilities of the client/server system will enable the consortium to provide new information and new information services not possible before, and will help consortium staff to meet the challenges of such a complex migration.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The increase (28.8 per cent) in the number of complaints from pre\u2010New NHS Complaints Procedure to the implementation of the new procedures in 1996 is a matter of concern because it is estimated that the current figure represents only 40 per cent of the number of people with some dissatisfaction. The Wilson Report prompted Government initiatives in producing a new NHS Complaints Procedure. The new procedure allows for complaints to be dealt with at a local level, or in a minority of cases through Independent Review. The new procedures, which were introduced in April 1996, oblige Trusts, GP practices and Health Boards to establish a Written Local Resolution process for handling complaints, responsibility for implementation lying with individual trusts. A preliminary assessment of the New Procedures was carried out in Lothian. A qualitative approach was utilised and semi\u2010structured taped interviews lasting on average one hour ten minutes were administered to the six complaints officers. This study concentrates on how the six Lothian NHS Trusts are implementing the new procedure, the openness in complaints handling, and the awareness of how complaints can be used to improve standards. The conclusion is that Local Resolution 1 has been successful, and that complaints do receive a speedy response. The process is much simpler and easier for the lay population to access. Reservations remain, however, towards the Independent Review procedure.</jats:p>",

In this situation, the curricula of information\ntraining institutions in Africa should reflect this reality.\nUnfortunately, the curricula of library and information science schools\nin Africa are geared towards the educated elites, as there is hardly any\ndifference between the curricula of information training schools in\nAfrica and the industrialized world, yet the situation in each setting\nis different. While the majority of Africans are rural people who are\nilliterate and mainly employed in farming and other unskilled jobs, the\nmajority of the users of information in the industrialized world are\nliterate. The services offered by information workers in Africa do not\nrelate to the information demands of the African setting and do not take\naccount of the fact that every individual, whether literate or\nilliterate, needs information. Recommends that information training\ninstitutions in Africa evolve curricula that will be mission oriented,\ngeared towards meeting the information demands of farmers, artisans,\ngrassroots politicians, the electorate, government decision makers,\nstudents, researchers and others. Recommends a conference of trainers,\nproviders and users of information to fashion out an appropriate\ncurriculum for African needs.</jats:p>",

Costs associated with any significant reduction in branch networks are likely to be too high, at least in the short term. Focuses on the less radical policy of adapting branch networks to the changing needs of the marketplace. As such it attempts to identify an appropriate strategy which will increase the effectiveness of branches by delivering a wide range of relatively complicated financial products traditionally associated with financial institutions without comprehensive branch networks. These objectives are facilitated by a questionnaire which examines the attitude and behaviour of customers towards financial products.</jats:p>",

This was attributed to the high reactivity of resorcinol as compared to the cashew nut shell liquid as shown by the gel times of the various resins.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The purpose of this case study was to investigate the learning strategies of police officers. Participants were 80 police officers serving in a Midwestern police agency. Of these, 49 were assigned to patrol duties and 31 were assigned to community oriented policing duties. Each participant completed the \u201cAssessing the Learning Strategies of Adults\u201d (ATLAS) instrument. When individual variables were examined in describing learning strategies among police officers, no significant differences were found using both chi\u2010square and a one\u2010way ANOVA. A multivariate discriminant analysis produced a recognizable discriminant function, and three variables met the criteria to be included in the interpretation of the meaning of the discriminant function. Predominately, male police officers prescribed to the learning strategy traits that are desired in community oriented policing. Police officers who ascribed to the learning strategies which are more congruent with traditional policing were slightly younger than the officers who ascribed to the learning strategy appropriate for community policing.

Significant opportunities exist for staff who are able to combine their professional task skills with good process skills. Convergence poses difficulties for managers of converged services in ensuring that all groups of library staff have the same opportunities to develop hybrid skills; and in finding training products suitable for staff working in a converged environment. It is anticipated that experience of working in converged services will enhance the career prospects of staff at all levels.</jats:p>",

Traditionally, computers are modeled by describing four primary features \u2010 their CPU, available memory, and input/output (I/O) capabilities. Applying this general model to portable microcomputers, this paper uses a scoring model methodology to develop a composite measure for the portable microcomputer marketplace and then evaluates the model\u2019s longitudinal performance. The technological scoring model methodology is a very pragmatic and highly subjective technique to derive a relative measure for identifying long\u2010term technological trends and rating/ranking individual machines one with another. Furthermore, employing the scoring model offers some unique challenges to the technological forecaster. However, the scoring model does seem to be a useful approach (at least for portable microcomputer technology) if used with due caution.</jats:p>",

Unfortunately, current measures of business activity are static and do not capture the dynamic flows of business transactions as they occur. Warning signs of pending changes are frequently not seen until after the fact when the financial impact of these changes is reported. It is our proposal that business transactions and performance can and should be measured in a dynamic rather than static manner. Recent advances in computer and communications technology combined with powerful multimedia software enable the construction of algorithms and on\u2010screen instruments which can be used to put business transactions and performance into a dynamic visible form that is readily understood by users.</jats:p>",

While doing so, we focus our attention on two dimensions: magnitude of investment and timing of entry. On the basis of the literature and empirical studies, we have developed a conceptual framework and defined measures for the desired level of the R&amp;D/marketing interface. This framework contributes to the literature on the R&amp;D/marketing interface by spelling out the interaction between the R&amp;D/marketing interface and entry strategy decision on new product performance. It also adds to the literature on new product introduction by focusing on the determinants of entry strategy and their impact on new product performance.</jats:p>",

Describes the involvement of eight regional library systems in the Unity Database, and the development plan, including the regional variations made possible by the flexibility of the system. Explains the coverage of the Unity Database, which is based on British Library data, plus the catalogues of member libraries, both public and academic, which provide records for all interlending materials. Includes the Pilot Interlending Project for Share the Vision, which incorporates the National Union Catalogue for Alternative Formats into the Unity Database and is developing a model for interlending of alternative formats. Discusses the role of the Unity System in the future development of interlending in Britain, and its potential application internationally.</jats:p>",
